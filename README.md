# Keplerian-rust
A Rust program I ported from C# to simulate Keplerian orbits.

## Dependencies
You'll need Cargo and Rust to run the example binary. You can get it [at rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

## Running
This project is a library crate, so you can't really 'run' that, but you can run the example binary.  
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Not-A-Normal-Robot/keplerian-rust`
2. Check out the available example binaries: `cargo run --example`
3. Run the example binary: `cargo run --example <binary_name>`

For the examples that dump a CSV, you can use external tools to chart it.  
One example is https://csvplot.com/.

## Resources
I did not come up with the algorithms myself. For more information and useful resources to learn about the algorithms used, check out the `CREDITS.md` file.
